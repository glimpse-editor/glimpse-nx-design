# Glimpse Design Repository

This repository will hold mockups and design discussions for future versions of the Glimpse Image Editor. If you would like to contribute, you must first read our [Code of Conduct](https://glimpse-editor.github.io/code-of-conduct/).

## Contributing

### Design Guidelines

Designs targeting the future versions of Glimpse - Glimpse NX - should use the [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/) as a base. These are not strict rules, but rather a
baseline to help provide a consistent, usable experience.
For current versions of Glimpse based on the GNU Image
Manipulation Program, designs should keep consistency with
the existing UI in mind. 

### Design Discussions

The "Issues" tab of this repository is meant to hold discussions
on designs for the Glimpse Image Editor and Glimpse NX. To start
a discussion, use one of the issue templates as a framework. A design proposal should include some of the following:

* Reasoning for proposal - what will users gain from this change?
* Issues with currently implemented designs
* Desired behavior after changes
* Prior art (e.g. how apps like Photoshop or GNU I.M.P handle this problem or task)

### Submitting Designs

As part of design discussion we want to encourage posting mockups
on issues. Once a design is posted and discussed, you may be asked
to submit a pull request with your art. These should be organized
like the following:

```
component-name/
  - component-name-author.png
  - src/
    - component-name-author.svg
```

Designs submitted here will be licensed under the CC-BY-SA creative commons license.
